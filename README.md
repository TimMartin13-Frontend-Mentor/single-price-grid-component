## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that sometimes designers make sure to throw 7 different font sizes in one design and other times, they leave out important information and I am just supposed to go with it. For example, there was no light cyan in the design document so I just used the lighten function.

```css
.bottom-right {
    background-color: lighten($cyan, 5%);
  }
```

### Continued development

I had fun adding the button animation for the hover state and I am going to start adding more animation to my projects.
